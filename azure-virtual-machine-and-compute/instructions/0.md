## **Scenario 1 - Building a Virtual Network**
An **Azure virtual network** (VNet) is a representation of your own **network**  in the cloud. It is a logical isolation of the **Azure** cloud dedicated to your subscription. You can fully control the IP address blocks, DNS settings, security policies and route tables within this **network.** [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview).

### **Building a Virtual Network**

1. Click on **+ Create a resource**
2. On the **New** blade, type <copy>**Virtual network**</copy> in the _Search the Marketplace_ search window and press **Enter**
3. Click on the **Create** button
4. On the **Create virtual network** blade, enter the following information:
    
    -  Subscription: **Select your subscription**.
    
    -  Resource group: Select the exisiting resource group named **azvmrg**
    
    -  Name: **DemoLabVnet1**
    
    > **Note:** If the portal advises the name is not unique, simply adjust the name. Once you create a unique name that is available, you will see a check mark at the end of the **Name** field.

    -  Region: Select the region you are using to perform the lab.
    
5. On the **Ip address** blade, enter the following information:

    -  Address Space: **10.2.0.0/24**
    
    -  Click on +Add Subnet and enter the subnet name: **demolabsubnet**

    -  Subnet address range: **10.2.0.0/26**

       >**Note:** This will supply 64 IP addresses for the virtual network.

6. Click on **Next:Security** and leave the default option for **DDoS Protection** and **firewall**.

7. Click on **Review+Create** button to review the configurations and then Click on **create** to deploy the Virtual Network.

This completes this scenario. Click **Next** to go to the next scenario.
